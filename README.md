# addonfactory-ucc-test
A framework to test UI-based Splunk Add-ons.

This is experimental version

To make it works:
1. copy run_modinput_test.sh, test_wrapper.py and swagger-codegen-generators to your TA test directory
2. make run_modinput_test.sh executable and run it, sending openapi.json for your TA as a parameter
3. follow instructions to customize test_wrapper.py

Feel free to contact me if something does not work for you or you've got feedback you'd like to share.
